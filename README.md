# Final Exam Project  
**KAN-CCMVI2085U – Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics in Business**  

## Project Overview  
This repository contains my **final exam submission** for the course **Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics in Business** at Copenhagen Business School.

**Exam conditions**: This project was completed as a **closed-book, individual written exam without help or external aids**, in accordance with CBS academic integrity policies.

The objective was to analyze a large dataset of used car listings and develop predictive models to estimate car prices. The project reflects a complete **machine learning pipeline**, including:

- Data loading and cleaning  
- Feature engineering and transformation  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Model development, comparison, and evaluation  
- Interpretation of results and business insight

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `scikit-learn`  
- **Models used**: Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor  

## Outcome  
This project demonstrates my ability to apply the theoretical and practical tools learned throughout the course to a real-world business challenge. I evaluated multiple regression models, selected the best-performing approach, interpreted key features, and translated findings into actionable insights for pricing strategy.

Through this assignment, I strengthened my skills in **data wrangling**, **visualization**, **model evaluation**, and the application of **machine learning to support data-driven business decisions**. It reflects my progression from foundational Python and statistics to applied predictive analytics.
